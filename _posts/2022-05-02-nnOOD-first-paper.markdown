My first paper 'nnOOD: A Framework for Benchmarking Self-supervised Anomaly Localisation Methods' has been accepted as Spotlight to [UNSURE 2022](https://unsuremiccai.github.io/)!
UNSURE is a workshop at [MICCAI 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/) focusing on using uncertanity maintain safety when applying machine learning techniques with medical imaging.
